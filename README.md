## Planning Story
--------------

For my first project for General Assembly's SEI program, I created a basic tic-tac-toe
web application.

As part of the project requirements, my game allows a user to create an account,
sign in, change their password, and sign out. A user can also start a game and play against themself, taking turns as X and O.
When the game is over, the user is told who the winner is, prevented from continuing to click the board, and given the option to play again.
Users are also able to check the total number of games they've played and how many games have been won by X or O.

## User Stories:
------------

- ### `As a player of Tic Tac Toe, I want to be able to be able to create an account and log in so that I can play the game.`
- ### `As a play of Tic Tac Toe, I want to be able to change my password.`
